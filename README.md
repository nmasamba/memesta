Memesta is a social network web application for sharing photo memes. It currently allows any user to upload a meme, like it or comment in it. The application runs on the JavaScript powered Node.js server, and was built using the Express.js framework. Various JS technologies such as jQuery, alongside the Handlebars templating engine and the Bootstrap library, were used on the front end. Data such as image memes and comments was persisted to mongoDB. The app is provided as it was when it was hosted on Heroku.
