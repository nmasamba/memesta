Memesta is a social network web application for sharing photo memes. It currently allows any user to upload a meme, like it or comment on it. The application runs on the JavaScript powered Node.js server, and was built using the Express.js framework. Various JS technologies such as jQuery, alongside the Handlebars templating engine and the Bootstrap library, were used on the front end. Data such as image memes and comments was persisted to mongoDB. Test files and the hosting Procfile are also included. The app is provided as it was when it was hosted on Heroku. 

Suggestions for improvements:
1. Introduce user authentication (currently, anyone who can supply an email address can comment), maybe using Passport.js
2. More work on front end design
